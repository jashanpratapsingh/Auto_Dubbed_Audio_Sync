00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
If you look in your C drive in 
Windows, some of you may notice  

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,039
a folder called Windows.old. But what 
exactly is it, and is it safe to delete?

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,540
The Windows.old folder may appear after a 
major upgrade, like from Windows 10 to 11,  

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,980
and simply contains a backup of your old 
installation of Windows. In this case,  

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,820
it shouldn't contain a backup of your 
personal files, just the system files.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,980
However, you may also have a Windows.old 
folder if you Reset Windows, where it may  

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,540
have given you the option to put all your 
personal files into that Windows.old folder,  

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,300
so be sure to copy any files 
that you want out of it.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,500
If the folder is from an upgrade, the 
purpose is to allow you to roll back and  

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,220
undo the upgrade if you want. So if you 
use Windows for a while with no issues,  

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,820
then it is safe to delete to free 
up space. If it's after a Reset,  

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,540
you can delete it once you're sure you 
backed up everything you want from in there.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,440
To delete it properly, search the start 
menu for "Disk Cleanup" and run it as  

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,500
Administrator - that's important. 
Choose the C Drive, and look here  

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,760
for "Previous Windows Installations", check 
that box and hit OK, and it will delete it.
