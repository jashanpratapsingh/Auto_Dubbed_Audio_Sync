1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,429
- [Jimmy] This is the first
out of 1,000 deaf people

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,690
we're gonna help hear again.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,580
And she hasn't heard her mother's voice

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,490
in four years.
(chime clicks)

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,130
Can you hear?
(gentle music)

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,204
- I love you.
(heartfelt music)

7
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:16,413
- [Jimmy] Aww. Next we helped Kayleah.

8
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:17,654
- What?
- Sudy.

9
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:19,530
- Whoa!
- And even entire families

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,850
hear their loved ones again.

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,320
But they are only a few

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,703
of the 1,000 people
(shutter clicking)

13
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:25,680
that we're gonna help hear again today.

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,840
We got our hands on over $3 million

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,460
worth of cutting-edge hearing technology,

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,840
that unlike old hearing aids,

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,910
analyzes people's specific hearing needs,

18
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,169
allowing them to hear again

19
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,730
without causing any damage.
(chime pinging)

20
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,230
- Can you hear me talking now?

21
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,540
- Yes.
- Oh my God. What?

22
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,266
He can hear me.
- [Jimmy] I'm gonna cry.

23
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:43,665
- [Daughter] You just saved my dad's life.

24
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,390
- [Jimmy] And our 10th person was Aisha.

25
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,530
- I used to watch him like a lot.

26
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,760
Like I'd like....
- Used to?!

27
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,705
- No. Stop.
- What happened?

28
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:50,915
Hey, you know what? This is over.

29
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,050
- No, (laughing) no, no, no.

30
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,059
- Go ahead. Do a test.
- Mommy?

31
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,200
- [Jimmy] She can't hear you yet,

32
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,673
but she will in three, two, one.

33
00:00:57,673 --> 00:00:58,989
(check mark clicks)
- Hello?

34
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:02,400
(mother gasps)
- I can hear my baby girl.

35
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,590
- I can hear my voice in
my left ear now. (laughs)

36
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,003
- [Jimmy] How's it sound?

37
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:07,080
Ha ha ha, he's dancing.

38
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,500
- Oh my God.
- This is amazing.

39
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,746
- Can you hear that?
- I can.

40
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:12,579
(shutter clicking)
- [Jimmy] At this point,

41
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,759
we've helped over 40 people hear again.

42
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,530
But on top of that, we wanted to give them

43
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,610
a little surprise.

44
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,058
This is $10,000, and it's yours.

45
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:22,590
(recipient laughing)
There you go.

46
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,170
We also want to give you
$10,000 to make this day

47
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,070
a little bit better.

48
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,152
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

49
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,904
Just don't have a heart attack, please.

50
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:30,060
(heart beating)

51
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,740
Which is better? Hearing or the 10 grand?

52
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,262
- The hearing, 'cause I can hear my baby.

53
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,479
- Do you watch the channel?
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,620
- Can you guys close your eyes

55
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,360
and can I borrow you for one second?

56
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,270
Can you tell them you
guys just won $10,000?

57
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,740
Okay. Open your eyes.

58
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,360
- You won $10,000.

59
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:48,120
- Oh my God.
(recipient laughs)

60
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,740
- I'd get home and have a heart attack.

61
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,059
- Please don't, what is with everyone

62
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,380
and having heart attacks this video?

63
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,369
Turn around and look at the camera,

64
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,320
and you just go "Subscribe."
- Subscribe.

65
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,660
- There you go. Ivy's
the next big YouTuber.

66
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,943
Why don't we give you $10,000, as well?

67
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:02,100
Here you go.

68
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,933
- [Recipient] The hearing aids was enough,

69
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,410
but that is awesome.

70
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,759
- Not only did we want to help you here,

71
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,507
we also wanted to give
you $10,000 on top of it.

72
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,724
(senior gasping)
- I'm rich!

73
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,100
- What are you gonna spend the money on?

74
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,239
- Jelly?

75
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,010
- You mentioned you have 12 grandkids?

76
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,359
Now, um.
- Oh!

77
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,283
- In here is $12,000.
- No way.

78
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:19,890
- So now you can give a grand

79
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,632
to each of your grandkids.

80
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,020
You can just tell me my
jokes are dumb. Here you go.

81
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,890
- What do you want me to do with this?

82
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,256
- Is there something you wanna buy?

83
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:29,250
- Lots of things I want to buy.

84
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,780
- Well, now you can. (laughing)

85
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,190
When we were talking earlier,

86
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,720
they mentioned you guys
enjoyed jet skiing.

87
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,553
Is there anything you want

88
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:36,000
but you don't wanna spend the money on?

89
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,670
- Jet ski for him. His jet ski broke down.

90
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,160
Who are you?
- MrBeast.

91
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,020
Seen any of the show?
- Can I hug you?

92
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,732
- Wait, did you just realize who I am?

93
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:45,565
- Yeah!
- Oh.

94
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,590
- I had no idea.
- Yeah.

95
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,940
I'm the one who helped you hear.

96
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,359
Well, now that you know who I am,

97
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,330
can I surprise you guys with something?

98
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,860
- Yeah.
- Okay, I went out,

99
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,830
and I bought a brand-new
jet ski for you guys.

100
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,290
- I was gonna sell my
wife to try to get one.

101
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,429
- Oh, really? I got you.
- Thank you so, so much.

102
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,620
- [Jimmy] And while we were
busy helping more people,

103
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,800
I sent Nolan to give a gift to
one of our youngest patients.

104
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,860
- I've got some custom
pink hearing aids for you.

105
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,120
- Look at those.

106
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,740
- Listen, what do you say
we go get some more toys?

107
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,890
(child laughs)

108
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,940
What do you say, we just
go to the Toy Alley?

109
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,380
You just go crazy, all right?
- Yeah.

110
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,882
- It's Jimmy's money.
- I'm taking all his money.

111
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:24,074
(Nolan laughs)
(upbeat music)

112
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:25,232
This man. Yes!

113
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:26,907
- Ooh. What's that?
- Do you like the sound?

114
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,507
(toy screaming)
- We need more.

115
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:31,974
Orbeez.
(scanner beeping)

116
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:36,089
This time, my best day
ever! Thank you, MrBeast!

117
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,950
- This is darnedest thing I ever heard of.

118
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,109
- Pretty cool, isn't it?
- And I mean, my word,

119
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,460
you know?
- [Technician] You can hear?

120
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,282
- I can hear really good.
- I hear myself pretty good.

121
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,540
(upbeat music)

122
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,859
- Try talking to him from back there.

123
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,530
- Colton, who's the
best quarterback, ever?

124
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,315
- Peyton Manning.
- He hears very well.

125
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,130
(all laughing)
- To test your new hearing,

126
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,019
we got you tickets to the upcoming

127
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,550
championship basketball game,

128
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,515
for you and your whole family to go to.

129
00:03:58,515 --> 00:03:59,940
(family laughing, exclaiming)

130
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,770
What better way to break
in your new hearing

131
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,765
than going to a Taylor Swift concert?

132
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:04,920
(recipient laughs)
You can experience it

133
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,753
with your new hearing.

134
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,989
- [Announcer] Welcome to
Houston, and hello friends.

135
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,840
- [Father] These are like
the best seats we've ever had

136
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,783
for a basketball game.
- There it is!

137
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:15,714
(buzzer ringing) (crowd cheering)

138
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:19,410
(rousing music)
- Thank you, MrBeast!

139
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,180
- But we didn't only want to help people

140
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,230
in the United States,

141
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,533
which is why we flew to Mexico
to help 200 deaf people.

142
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,539
Come on.

143
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,580
Leo Bardo and Selmai have always wanted

144
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,130
to hear their daughter's voice.

145
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,100
But are unable to afford
hearing technology.

146
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,470
However, today that's about to change.

147
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,150
- Their saying repeatedly,
over sign language,

148
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,159
they're so excited to hear
her say "mama and papa,"

149
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,120
for the first time.
(gentle music)

150
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,913
They're flicking 'em on. Okay. 3, 2, 1.

151
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:52,332
- Papa.
(gentle piano music)

152
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,290
- [Interpreter] Papa?

153
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,957
Papa?
- You can hear?

154
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:57,965
You can hear?
- Great.

155
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,460
- Yeah.
- Thank you for

156
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,750
doing this for me.

157
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,767
Thank you.

158
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:02,807
- [Jimmy] You should be able to hear now.

159
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:05,073
What's it like?

160
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,230
Aww. Aww.
(triumphant music)

161
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,440
She hasn't heard properly for 67 years.

162
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,674
3, 2, 1. (Jimmy speaking Spanish)

163
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:19,114
- Bien.
- Yeah?

164
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:21,210
(patient speaking Spanish)
- Oh.

165
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,890
How much different is it?
- Mucho.

166
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,473
- Wow.

167
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:25,675
- Wow.

168
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:27,033
- Oh.
(patient exclaiming)

169
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,800
(recipients laughing)
(intense dramatic music)

170
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,258
- [Jimmy] Great. And we
also went to Guatemala,

171
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:35,310
(recipient laughing)
Brazil.

172
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,190
And we also helped hundreds
of people in South Africa,

173
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,413
Malawi, and Indonesia.

174
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,809
And I learned while filming this video

175
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,750
that providing hearing isn't
the only way to connect people.

176
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,583
- [Together] Go team!

177
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,930
- [Jimmy] Sign language connects people

178
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,400
whether they can hear or not.

179
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,289
But access to learning sign language

180
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,330
is still very limited in many places.

181
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,270
So we're gonna donate
$100,000 to organizations

182
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,940
around the world that are
teaching people sign language.

183
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,900
But aside from that,

184
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,299
we still have our final
person left to help.

185
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:08,299
